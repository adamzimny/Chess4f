Chess4f

This is a very simple implementation of chess.
AI uses a simple brute-force search but interesting paths (with captures and
checks) are analyzed deeper.
Algorithm is strong enough to beat a beginning player. It might not be able to
finish the game if checkmate requires deeper analysis than the maximum level set
in the code (there are no specialized strategies implemented to finish the 
game).

En passant and promotion are not implemented yet.

* Requirements:
ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
JDK 8 (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html)
